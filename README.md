## 🌟 Overview

Flowppies is an innovative Web3 gaming platform that combines AI-generated NFT pets with interactive gameplay on the Flow blockchain. Users can create, train, and battle unique digital companions in a gasless environment powered by Flow's native VRF (Verifiable Random Function) and sponsored transaction system.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 AI-Powered Pet Generation

- **AI Image Creation**: Powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash with advanced image generation capabilities
- **Custom Art Styles**: Choose from multiple styles including Pixel Art, Watercolor, 3D Render, Anime, and more
- **Dynamic Backstories**: AI-generated lore that evolves with your pet's journey
- **Unique Attributes**: Each pet has distinctive traits including Happiness, Power, Level, and Multiplier stats


### 🎲 Flow's Native VRF Integration

Token Tails uses Flow's Verifiable Random Function (VRF)  - a feature exclusive to Flow blockchain.

**How It Works:**

- **Battle Outcomes**: 70% pet stats + 30% cryptographic randomness
- **Zero Cost**: Free randomness (costs \$10+ on other chains)
- **Instant Results**: No waiting for oracles
- **Provably Fair**: Mathematical proof of fairness

  

**Implementation:**

```
// Get random number from Flow's native VRF
(bool ok, bytes memory data) = cadenceArch.staticcall(
    abi.encodeWithSignature("revertibleRandom()")
);
uint64 randomNumber = abi.decode(data, (uint64));

// Calculate fair battle outcome
uint256 pet1Power = pet1Stats + (randomNumber % 1000);
uint256 pet2Power = pet2Stats + ((randomNumber / 1000) % 1000);
```
